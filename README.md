# FlightRoutesCalculator

## Considerations ##

1. I have decided to implement this solution in Java since I could not make it work with C# - not even the first steps :'( due 
to no prior experience with C# and no IDE.
2. I have not implemented a Java API for reflecting what the backend should be: 
I tried to follow as much as possible the MVC pattern suggested in Fiddle.net, https://dotnetfiddle.net/DeFDBC .
3. I have not implemented the front end part. I have no prior experience with raw JS, only with ReactJs.
I leave attached another repository where I precisely build a Java Spring Boot Backend + ReactJs frontend: https://github.com/gmorenofigols/react-challenge .

## Instructions ##

There is only need to run `MVCPatternDemo.java` to check the results from the API mockup.
